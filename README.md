## What I Found Interesting

I find the concept of recording dreams to be extremely intresting for a number of reasons. One, it shows the power of software and ai and pushes boundaries that I hadn't even concieved of. Two, recording dreams offers a unique view into how people organize their thoughts, as well as it allows us to study the brain in a way that we never have before. Three, imagine all of the creativity and ingenuity that could come from mainstream dream recording. If I could record my dreams and then go back and watch them I could better understand myself. Instead of a fleeting memory of what happened in my sleep it would be a concrete piece of media that I can watch at my leisure. Therapy could be revolutioned and changed fundamentally. To sum, I find this article interesting because it completely upends how we view dreams and opens numerous doors in various fields.
